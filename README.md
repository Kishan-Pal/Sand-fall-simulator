# SandBox Simulation

This is a simple SandBox simulation built using React, where particles (represented as sand) fall and interact with each other. The particles are placed in a grid, and users can click and drag to add sand particles, which then follow gravity and move downward or to the side if blocked.

## Features

- **Dynamic Sand Particles**: Sand particles fall and interact with other particles in the grid, simulating simple physics.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Click and drag your mouse across the grid to add sand particles.
- **Colorful Particles**: Sand particles are assigned random colors for a visually appealing effect.
- **Responsive Grid**: The grid size can be easily adjusted by changing the number of pixels and viewport size.
